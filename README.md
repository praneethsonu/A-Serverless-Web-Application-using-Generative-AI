# Harnessing Generative AI for a Serverless Web Application 

## Description
Build a serverless web application powered by Generative AI using Amazon Bedrock and the Claude 3 Sonnet foundation model. Users can enter a list of ingredients, and the application will generate delicious recipes based on the input ingredients. The application includes an HTML-based user interface for ingredient submission and a backend web app to request AI-generated recipes.

## Application Architecture
The following diagram provides a visual representation of the services used in this application using AWS Amplify, a GraphQL API built with AWS AppSync, AWS Lambda, and Amazon Bedrock.
